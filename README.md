How to install arch linux from scratch, because people need something working and clear.
## Prerequisites:

## Preparing the install

- Download and install and open [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) (on windows) or [balenaetcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) (on linux)

- Wait till the end
- Unplug the usb drive and plug it into the pc your want to install arch on
- Boot the pc on the usb drive, find the key you need to press at boot to show the boot menu (F12, F11, F9, F2, F1, DEL or ECHAP usually, refer to your motherboard manufacturer for this), select the usb and boot it
